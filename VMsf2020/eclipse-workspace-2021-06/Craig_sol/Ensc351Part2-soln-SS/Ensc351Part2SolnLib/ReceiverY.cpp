/* Only called after an SOH character has been received.
The function receives the remaining characters to form a complete
block.
The function will set or reset a Boolean variable,
goodBlk. This variable will be set (made true) only if the
calculated checksum or CRC agrees with the
one received and the received block number and received complement
are consistent with each other.
Boolean member variable syncLoss will only be set to
true when goodBlk is set to true AND there is a
fatal loss of syncronization as described in the XMODEM/YMODEM
specification.
The member variable goodBlk1st will be made true only if this is the first
time that the block was received in "good" condition. Otherwise
goodBlk1st will be made false.
